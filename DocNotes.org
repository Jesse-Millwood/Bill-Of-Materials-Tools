* Introduction
  BOM Tools is meant to aid in creating Bill of Materials spreadsheets
  from part information extracted from SoftCAD Eagle and organizeing it 
  in a sane way. 

  BOM Tools can take a standard Bill Of Materials in *.xlsx form and insert
  the part information with out messing up other text and cell formulas
  that were already there.

  BOM Tools can also import part information from a spreadsheet and save it as
  a serialized python object.
  This can be useful for when stock part information is saved in a spreadsheet
  and it is required to indicate wheter a part in a project is a stock part.
